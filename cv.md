#### About me ####

> I graduated from the Belarusian State University of Economics in 2015 with a degree in Economics and Enterprise Management, in the same year I started working as an inspector at the Bobruisk customs post. I have mastered the necessary skills and knowledge for customs control from scratch, additionally performed the functions of the administrator of software products during the entire time of work. In the process of work, I began to pay a lot of attention to the IT field and decided to change the field of activity.
